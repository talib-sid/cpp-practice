Round 1: (1.5 Hours)
Shadab Zafar (SDE-III)

- Asked about myself, basic intro about interests and knowledge domains
- Asked me what operating system do you use and some questions about which version of Ubuntu and why not a custom distro
- Glanced at my resume, asked what I did at Samsung, didn't cross question any of this
- Asked about my Internship from 2 years ago at a data lab here at IIITH, what is UDP, how did you implement this in NodeJs, 
wrote some pseudo-code and explained how datagrams and all work, asked about differences in TCP, UDP, 
where and when to prefer to each, asked this via examples of use cases and asked for my preferences in each
- OSI Model Layers (7 of them), I was only able to list 5 of them but he seemed satisfied, asked some details on these 5 as well
- What does connectionless protocol mean? Which one is ssh, how do you ssh, what is Turn Around Time? Latency vs Jitter? 
- Gave a scenario where the solution was to have a 3-way handshake
- Cache Eviction vs Cache Invalidation, how do you evaluate which data block should be evicted or invalidated
- Questions on Cache Aware Algorithms, Cache Oblivious Algorithms, Cache Coherence, 
- Cache Exploiting, Cache Locality (arch level),
- He was dwelving deep into Computer Arch and compilers before realising I have not taken a dedicated course for the same,
upon being confused on a register question, he asked if I have done any coursework on the same.
- Grilled for 10-15 mins on Cache Aware Algorithms and how to load into memory the efficient way 
  for a Matrix Mult (rapid fire, very stressful)
- Methods for processes to communicate? Kernel Mode vs User Mode, why and when is each needed
- MPI and how it works, gave basic C MPI code and design of how message passsing between threads would reduce into master
- Github and basic git commands, linux command to kill a process, to see the pid, to see the current procs, cpu load
- Came back to my Samsung Internship and asked about AI and Python along the lines of CV and DL, asked me to design a 
basic Neural Network for identification of features, CNN for a number identification.
