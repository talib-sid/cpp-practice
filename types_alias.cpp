    // If we want the deduced type to have a top-level const, we must say so explicitly:
    // const auto f = ci; // deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int

    // initialization rules still apply:
    // auto &g = ci; // g is a const int& that is bound to ci
    // auto &h = 42; // error: we canâ€™t bind a plain reference to a literal
    // const auto &j = 42; // ok: we can bind a const reference to a literal
    //NOTE:
    //  When we ask for a reference to an auto-deduced type, top-level consts in the
    // initializer are not ignored. As usual, consts are not top-level when we bind a
    // reference to an initializer

    // As usual, the initializers must provide consistent
    // auto-deduced types:
    // auto k = ci, &l = i; // k is int; l is int&
    // auto &m = ci, *p = &ci; // m is a const int&; p is a pointer to const int
    // // error: type deduced from i is int; type deduced from &ci is const int
    // auto &n = i, *p2 = &ci;

    // For such cases, the new standard introduced a second type specifier, decltype,
    // which returns the type of its operand. The compiler analyzes the expression to
    // determine its type but does not evaluate the expression:

    // decltype(f()) sum = x; // sum has whatever type f returns

    // Here, the compiler does not call f, but it uses the type that such a call would return
    // as the type for sum. That is, the compiler gives sum the same type as the type that
    // would be returned if we were to call f.
